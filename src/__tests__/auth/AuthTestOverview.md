# Authentication Testing Overview

## User Authentication Flow Tests

### Login Process
- Verifies that users can successfully log in with valid credentials.
- Ensures proper session management (access tokens and refresh tokens).
- Validates secure cookie handling for maintaining user sessions.
- Tests error scenarios like invalid passwords or non-existent accounts.

### Registration Process
- Validates new user registration with proper input validation:
  - Name requirements (2-50 characters).
  - Email format validation.
  - Password strength requirements (uppercase, lowercase, numbers, special characters).
- Ensures proper user profile creation in the database.
- Tests error handling for duplicate email addresses.
- Verifies email confirmation flow initiation.

### Session Management
- Tests token refresh mechanism for extending user sessions.
- Validates secure logout process and proper session cleanup.
- Ensures refresh tokens are properly rotated for security.
- Verifies that expired or invalid tokens are properly handled.

### Email Verification
- Tests the email confirmation resend functionality.
- Validates handling of already verified accounts.
- Ensures proper error handling for email service issues.

## Security Measures Tested
- Secure cookie handling with proper flags (httpOnly, secure, sameSite).
- Protection against invalid or expired tokens.
- Proper error responses that don't leak sensitive information.
- Session invalidation during logout.

---

## Error Handling
- Validates proper error responses for all failure scenarios:
  - Invalid credentials (401 errors).
  - Bad requests (400 errors).
  - Server errors (500 errors).
- Ensures user-friendly error messages are returned.
- Verifies that sensitive information is never exposed in error responses.

---

## Integration Testing
- Validates proper routing of all authentication endpoints.
- Tests integration with Supabase authentication service.
- Ensures database operations for user profiles work correctly.
- Verifies JWT token creation and validation.

This testing suite ensures a robust, secure authentication system that handles both successful flows and error cases appropriately, while maintaining security best practices throughout the entire authentication process.
