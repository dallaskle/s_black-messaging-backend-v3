## üóÑÔ∏è Database Schema

### Tables

#### `channels`
- `id` (UUID)
- `workspace_id` (UUID)
- `name` (string)
- `is_private` (boolean)
- `type` (enum: 'channel' | 'dm')
- `topic` (string, optional)
- `description` (string, optional)
- `created_by` (UUID)
- `created_at` (timestamp)
- `updated_at` (timestamp)

#### `channel_members`
- `channel_id` (UUID)
- `user_id` (UUID)

## üîÑ Operational Flows

### 1. Channel Creation
1. Validate user workspace membership
2. Create channel record
3. Set privacy settings
4. Add creator as admin for private channels

### 2. DM Channel Creation
1. Verify both users' workspace membership
2. Check for existing DM channel
3. Create new DM channel if none exists
4. Add both users as members

### 3. Member Management
1. Verify channel privacy status
2. Check admin permissions
3. Validate new member's workspace membership
4. Add member with appropriate role

### 4. Access Control Flow
1. Authenticate user request
2. Check workspace membership
3. Verify channel access rights
4. Validate specific operation permissions

## üõ°Ô∏è Error Handling

### Error Categories
- **Authentication Errors:**
  - Missing/invalid token
  - Unauthorized access
- **Permission Errors:**
  - Insufficient privileges
  - Invalid role assignments
- **Resource Errors:**
  - Channel not found
  - Invalid member operations
- **Validation Errors:**
  - Duplicate entries
  - Invalid data formats
